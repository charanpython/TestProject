# Git Practicals
---
1. To create local repository
    ~~~
    # mkdir /gitlab
    # cd /gitlab
    # git init
    It will create .git directory. Where
    the .git directory is there that is local repository.

    ~~~

3. If you want to move all files to staging area

5. To move a particular file from Stating space area to local repository
    ~~~
    # git commit -m "<commit_name>" <file_name>
    ~~~
    
    i) without email and username we can't commit the file/s so, we have to set email and username globally
    
    git config --list
    
    git config --global user.email "email-id"
    git config --global user.name "username"
    
    git config --global --unset user.email "email-id"

6. If you want to commit all files to local repository
    ~~~
    # git commit -m "<commit_name>"
    ~~~

7. To see the commit messages?
    ~~~
    # git log 
    ~~~
8. To see the content of the commit?
    ~~~
    # git show <commit_number>
    # git log --oneline
    # git log --since=2018-01-21
    # git log --until=2018-03-18
    # git log --author="harishkolanu235"
    # git log --grep="index"
    # git log --oneline --author="harishkolanu235"
    # git log --oneline --name-only    ----> Show only names of changed files.
    # git log --oneline  --pretty=format:%h%x09%an%x09%ad%x09%s 
		%h ---> commit_id
		%x09 ---> space
		%an ----> author name
		%ad -----> date and time
		%s ----> commit message

    ~~~
   
9. To show the recent commit logs
    ~~~
    # git log -5
    ~~~

10. To see the difference between 2 commits
    ~~~
    # git diff <commit_id1>..<commit_id2>
    ~~~

11. To list of all branch
    ~~~
    # git branch

    Note: (*) represents your currently in that branch.
    ~~~

12. How to get back a commit to staging area?

    ~~~
    # git reset head <file_name>
    ~~~
14. How to get back a commit to work area?
    ~~~

    Note: We can get back first commit also but need repository default files commit Id
    ~~~

15. discard the latest commit perminately including commit files ?

    ~~~
    
16. When file have staging area or file have committed if file is deleted in local repository unfortunately how to get back that file to staging area?
    ~~~
    # git checkout -- <file_name>
    ~~~

17. To Create branch
    ~~~
    # git branch < branch_name >
    ~~~
18. Change the branch
    ~~~
    # git checkout <branch_name>

    Note: when newly or first-time checkout to branch, while checkout the committed files must copied from another branch to newly    checkout branch.
    Whenever checkout to another branch, Uncommitted files are copied to checkout branch evrytime.
    ~~~

    # git diff <branch1>..<branch2 >  
    ~~~
21. To delete the branch
    ~~~
    # git branch -d <branch_name>
    
    Note: if you want to delete forcefully, we can use below command
    # git branch -D <branch_name>
    ~~~
22. How do you push the files to master branch in remote repo?
    ~~~
    # git push (you must be in master branch)
    ~~~
23. How do you push files from local to particular branch in remote repo?
    ~~~
